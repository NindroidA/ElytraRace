# Plugin Integrations & Publishing Guide

Guide for integrating ElytraRace with other plugins and publishing to plugin marketplaces.

---

## Publishing Platforms

### Understanding Plugin Marketplaces

**Important**: ElytraRace is a Bukkit/Spigot/Paper plugin, not a Forge/Fabric mod. This affects where you can publish.

#### CurseForge
- **Status**: ❌ Not Recommended
- **Why**: Primarily hosts Forge/Fabric mods
- **Bukkit Support**: Limited and not promoted
- **Better Alternative**: Use SpigotMC or Modrinth instead

#### Modrinth
- **Status**: ✅ Recommended
- **Plugin Support**: Yes, actively supported
- **Requirements**: Open source recommended, clear documentation
- **Benefits**: Modern platform, growing community

Used for region selection and setup.

**Maven Dependency**:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sk89q.worldedit</groupId>
    <artifactId>worldedit-bukkit</artifactId>
    <version>7.3.3</version>

</dependency>
```

**Usage in Plugin**:

### PlaceholderAPI (Future Integration)

For displaying race stats in scoreboards, tab lists, etc.

**Maven Dependency**:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>me.clip</groupId>
    <artifactId>placeholderapi</artifactId>
    <version>2.11.5</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

**Proposed Placeholders**:
```
%elytrarace_wins%       - Player's total wins
%elytrarace_races%      - Total races completed
%elytrarace_best_time%  - Best race time
%elytrarace_avg_time%   - Average race time
%elytrarace_win_rate%   - Win percentage
%elytrarace_rank%       - Leaderboard position
```

**Implementation Example**:
```java
public class RacePlaceholders extends PlaceholderExpansion {
    
    @Override
    public String onPlaceholderRequest(Player player, String identifier) {
        if (player == null) return "";
        
        StatsManager.PlayerStats stats = plugin.getStatsManager()
            .getStats(player.getUniqueId());
        
        return switch (identifier) {
            case "wins" -> String.valueOf(stats.getWins());
            case "races" -> String.valueOf(stats.getRaces());
            case "best_time" -> String.format("%.2f", stats.getBestTime());
            case "win_rate" -> String.format("%.1f%%", stats.getWinRate());
            default -> null;
        };
    }
}
```

### Vault (Economy Integration)

Add entry fees and win rewards.

**Maven Dependency**:

### LuckPerms (Permission Management)

Already compatible. Works out of the box with permission nodes:

```
race.use        - Basic commands
race.admin      - Setup commands
race.stats      - View statistics
race.top        - View leaderboard
```

**Setup**:

### Discord Integration

Send race results to Discord via webhooks.

**Implementation Example**:
```java
public class DiscordNotifier {
    private final String webhookUrl;
    
    public void postRaceResults(String winner, double time) {
        JSONObject embed = new JSONObject()
            .put("title", "Race Completed!")
            .put("description", winner + " won in " + time + " seconds")
            .put("color", 0xFFD700);
        
        JSONObject payload = new JSONObject()
            .put("embeds", new JSONArray().put(embed));
        
        // Send POST request to webhookUrl
    }
}
```

**Config**:
```yaml
discord:
  enabled: true
  webhook-url: "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
  post-results: true
  post-records: true
  mention-role: "123456789"  # Role ID to mention
```

### Multiverse-Core (Multi-World Support)

Already compatible. Each world can have its own race track.

No additional code needed - the plugin already stores world names with locations.
