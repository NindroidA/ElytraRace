## 🌿 Branch Naming Convention

**All branches MUST follow this naming pattern**: `type/issue-number-description`

### Branch Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `feature/` | New features | `feature/123-team-racing` |
| `bugfix/` | Bug fixes | `bugfix/124-fix-timer-bug` |
| `hotfix/` | Urgent production fixes | `hotfix/125-critical-crash` |
| `docs/` | Documentation updates | `docs/126-update-readme` |
| `refactor/` | Code refactoring | `refactor/127-optimize-race-logic` |
| `test/` | Tests and improvements | `test/128-add-unit-tests` |
| `chore/` | Dependencies, config | `chore/129-update-paper-api` |

### Examples

✅ **Good Branch Names**:
```bash
feature/130-add-checkpoint-system
bugfix/131-prevent-double-join
hotfix/132-fix-leaderboard-crash
docs/133-add-api-documentation
refactor/134-optimize-race-manager
test/135-add-race-tests
chore/136-update-dependencies
```

❌ **Bad Branch Names**:
```bash
feature              # Missing issue number and description
feature-1            # Should use slash, not dash
Feature/1-test       # Should be lowercase
my-fix               # Missing type and issue number
new-feature          # Missing issue number
```
